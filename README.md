Android application to check sentiment analysis fo news articles

The full source code for the application can be found in the provided github link under the following directories:
•	Source code: see folder .\app\src\main\java\com\example\articlebiases
Here there will be three java files that are main and the two fragmenet.

•	Build apk: see folder .\app\build\outputs\apk\debug
Here there will be app-debu.apk which can be installed in any android device to execute the file

To run the program and view the code I suggest of opening the project with Android studio, 
there is the choice of using a virtual device or you can run it in your own android device. 
There should not be needed to do anything else other than building the program and get virtual 
device started and the apk installed. If you use Android studio when you build this will be 
done by the ide itself.
